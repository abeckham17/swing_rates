# Swing Rates
- The goal of this repository is to track changes in overall swing rate, zone swing rate, and reach rate over the course of college baseball game.
- The changes in the three swing rates over the course of the game are minimal.
- The final graphs, had they shown more extreme changes in overall swing rate, zone swing rate, and reach rate  on even a single pitch could have influenced reliever usage. For example, if hitters were more far reluctant to swing at curveballs in the zone later in the game, then a curveball that could induce called striked would be more useful later in the game.
